# Non-stationary-signal-analysis

Throughout the project, our basic motive is to analyse non stationary 
signals using Short Time Fourier Transform(STFT) and wavelet transform by 
analysing their power spectrum respectively. The analysis started by 
understanding the basic concept of STFT and wavelet transform. This
project is realized in MATLAB and the report contains all the necessary codes as well.
